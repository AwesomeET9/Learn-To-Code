        To learn HTML on VS Code (Visual Studio Code), we must learn the basics.
        Let's Start on the Start.
        </p>
        <h6>
        With VS Code, you can find meanings of the code you write!
        </h6>
        <hr />
        <h4>
        Preamble & Head
        </h4>
        <p>
        For a HTML Document, you must have a into!
        </p>
        <h5>
        MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR DOCUMENT CODE AS HTML!
        </h5>
        <p>
        First we need to type this:
        </p>
        <img src="Desktop/Screen Shot 2022-04-11 at 1.54.32 PM.png">
        <p>
        Then, we must add a head. For a basic Document, you can do this:
        </p>
        <img src="Desktop/Screen Shot 2022-04-11 at 1.59.30 PM.png">
        <p>
       Now, your document should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="Desktop/Screen Shot 2022-04-11 at 2.06.24 PM.png">
        <hr />
        <h4>
       The BODY!
         </h4>
        <p>
       Now, before /head and after /html, we will add the body!
       We can do this for the body!:
        </p>
        <img src="Desktop/Screen Shot 2022-04-11 at 2.16.47 PM.png">
        <p>
       Your Document should look like this!
        </p>
        <img src="Desktop/Screen Shot 2022-04-11 at 2.19.47 PM.png">
        <hr />
        <h4>
       Time to save!
        </h4>
     <p>
       Now we have to save our document!
    </p>
    <img src="Desktop/Screen Shot 2022-04-11 at 2.23.45 PM.png">
    <p>
       You can do another save option, but it must save. Once you save it, you can go to your favoorite browser and open it. The code is in your Finder/C drive
   </p>
   <P>
       MAKE SURE YOU PUT TEST.HTML IN THE BOX WHEN SAVING!
